**Online Retail Transaction Analysis** is a comprehensive data analysis tool to provide insights through interactive dashboards: to analyse customer behaviour, optimise pricing and marketing strategies and identify popular products.

Team Members:
- Beth Williams
- Pete Smith
- Tom Burgess

## Dataset Content

The dataset contains information on customer transactions made through an online retail platform. It includes the following columns:

- **InvoiceNo:** Transaction number
- **StockCode:** Product number
- **Description:** Product name
- **Quantity:** Quantity sold (negative for cancelled orders)
- **InvoiceDate:** Date and time of transaction
- **UnitPrice:** Price of one unit of the item
- **CustomerID:** Unique customer identifier
- **Country:** Customer location

## Business Requirements

-   Describe your business requirements

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

-   General Sales trends/Descriptive Stats: Tom
-   Customer behaviour patterns: Pete
-   Products: Beth: The top 10 products provide the most revenue
-   (Geographic)


## Project Plan

-   ?Mention that Saturdays are missing. Perhaps the company providing the online transactions did not want to provide the Saturday data as this is their busiest day and competitors would be most interested in this?

-   Outline the high-level steps taken for the analysis.
-   How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
-   Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations

-   List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used

-   List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
-   How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
-   Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
-   How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations

-   The Customer ID was anonymised. 

-   Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
-   How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design

-   List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
-   Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
-   How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
-   Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences.

## Conclusions

-
-

## Unfixed Bugs

-   Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.


## Development Roadmap

-   Power BI: sharing files, learning about relative paths
-   (if we need something else here, include updating the requirements.txt file?)

-   What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
-   What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience?
-   Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
-   If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.
